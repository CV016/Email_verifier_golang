# Email_verifier_golang

In this project I have tried to build a small Scale Email Verifier with Golang Language 
the following programs Checks upon 

domain , MX , SPF , sprRecord , DMARC , dmarcRecord

where the domain name needs to be entered

Domain: In the context of email, a domain refers to the unique identifier that appears after the @ symbol in an email address

MX (Mail Exchange): MX records are part of the Domain Name System (DNS) that direct emails to the correct mail server\

SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method that verifies that a message has been sent from an authorized mail server.

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): DMARC is an email security protocol that verifies email senders by building on the DNS, DKIM, and SPF protocols.
